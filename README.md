# ForgetMe

[![build](https://github.com/omkar-sanadi/ForgetMe/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/omkar-sanadi/ForgetMe/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> One request in, every system cleaned, proof out.

A self-hosted orchestrator for "delete my data" requests (GDPR Art. 17, India's DPDP Act, CCPA), built with Spring Boot.

**Status:** 🟡 Milestones 1–5 done (29/29 tests passing, demo and load test run end to end); only the live deployment is left, and it needs a server. Requests are verified, fanned out to every registered system stage by stage with signed messages and retries, recorded in a tamper-evident audit log, and closed with a certificate. A Spring Boot starter turns any app into a connector, one command runs a four-service demo company, and there's an admin page, rate limiting, a prod profile, OpenAPI docs and CI. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

**Try it in one command:** `docker compose --profile demo up --build`, then [delete Alice](#option-a-the-full-demo-one-command).

## The problem

One user's personal data lives in many places: the users database, orders, file uploads, the search index, analytics, the email provider, logs, backups. When that user asks to be deleted, the law sets a deadline (GDPR: one month), and the company must be able to show it actually happened.

Small teams handle this with a spreadsheet and hand-written SQL. Things get missed and there's no proof. Enterprise tools (OneTrust, Transcend, DataGrail) solve it at enterprise prices.

## What ForgetMe does

- ✅ **Verifies** the requester owns the email address before anything runs
- ✅ Tracks the **legal deadline** (30 days) from the moment a request arrives
- ✅ Waits a **cooling-off period** so the user can cancel
- ✅ **Fans out** to every registered system (a *connector*) in a safe order
- ✅ **Retries** connectors that fail or go silent, and escalates to a human when retries run out
- ✅ Records every step in a **tamper-evident audit log** (HMAC hash chain + append-only trigger)
- ✅ Issues a **completion certificate** listing what each system did, pinned to the audit log
- ✅ **Deletes its own copy** of the email when a request finishes, keeping only a keyed fingerprint
- ✅ **Warns the admin** by email at 7 days before the legal deadline, and again if it's missed
- ✅ Ships a **Spring Boot starter** that turns any service into a connector in about 5 lines
- ✅ Comes with a **demo company** (mailing list, orders, uploads, user accounts) that runs with one command
- ✅ Has a **page for the requester** (`/`): ask, confirm with the emailed code, watch each system report in, get a receipt
- ✅ Has an **admin page** (`/admin`): every request, each system's progress, the full history, a retry button
- ✅ **Rate-limits** public endpoints per IP and per subject, and can restrict which email domains it accepts

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[User request] --> V[Verify identity] --> C[Cooling-off] --> S1
    subgraph Fan-out in stages
      S1["Stage 1: stop processing<br/>(unsubscribe, disable login)"] --> S2["Stage 2: downstream, in parallel<br/>(orders, uploads, search, analytics)"] --> S3["Stage 3: primary user store"]
    end
    S3 --> P["Erase own copy of the email<br/>(keep keyed fingerprint)"] --> R[Certificate + audit log]
```

**Why stages?** The primary user record is deleted *last*. Until every downstream system is done, the orchestrator still needs the user's identifiers (email, phone, payment customer ID) to find their data. Stages are just numbers on connectors: every connector with the lowest number goes first, in parallel; the next number starts only when all of those have reported back.

### Request lifecycle

Enforced by `RequestStatus.moveTo()`: any move not drawn here throws. Every move goes through `AuditLog.move()`, so each one is also written to the audit log. Reaching a final state (`COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`, `REJECTED`) erases the stored email.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RECEIVED
    RECEIVED --> WAITING: code confirmed
    RECEIVED --> REJECTED: code expired / 5 wrong attempts
    RECEIVED --> CANCELLED
    WAITING --> CANCELLED
    WAITING --> RUNNING: cooling-off over
    RUNNING --> COMPLETED: last stage done
    RUNNING --> NEEDS_ATTENTION: a task ran out of attempts
    NEEDS_ATTENTION --> RUNNING: admin retry / late report
    COMPLETED --> [*]
```

### Task lifecycle

A task is one connector's share of one request.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING
    PENDING --> SENT: connector answered 2xx
    PENDING --> PENDING: error, wait and retry (10s, 20s, 40s…)
    SENT --> SENT: no report in time, send again
    PENDING --> DONE: signed report
    SENT --> DONE: signed report
    PENDING --> FAILED: 5 attempts used
    SENT --> FAILED: 5 attempts used
    FAILED --> PENDING: admin retry
    FAILED --> DONE: late report
```

### Connector results

| Result | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `DELETED` | Data removed | Uploaded profile photos |
| `ANONYMIZED` | Personal fields blanked, record kept | Order rows kept for revenue stats |
| `RETAINED` + note | Kept on purpose, reason recorded | Invoices kept 8 years for tax law |

### Connector protocol

**ForgetMe → connector**

```
POST {endpointUrl}
Content-Type: application/json
X-ForgetMe-Timestamp: 1790090000
X-ForgetMe-Signature: sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256(secret, "<timestamp>.<body>")>

{"taskId":"…","requestId":"…","email":"alice@example.com","callbackUrl":"http://…/api/callbacks/<taskId>"}
```

Answer any `2xx` to accept the job, then do the work in your own time. Anything else (or no answer within 10 s) counts as a failure and is retried.

**Connector → ForgetMe**, same two headers, signed with the same secret:

```
POST {callbackUrl}
{"result":"DELETED" | "ANONYMIZED" | "RETAINED", "note":"optional, e.g. why data was kept"}
```

Answers: `204` accepted · `401` bad or older-than-5-minutes signature · `400` unreadable · `404` unknown task.

Three rules for connectors: **be idempotent** (the same `taskId` can arrive more than once), **report within `callback-timeout`** (5 min by default) or the job is sent again, and **keep personal data out of `note`**, because notes are copied into the permanent audit log.

### Audit log and certificate

Every event (`RECEIVED`, `WRONG_CODE`, `WAITING`, `RUNNING`, `STAGE_STARTED`, `TASK_DONE`, `TASK_FAILED`, `NEEDS_ATTENTION`, `COMPLETED`, `DEADLINE_WARNING`, …) is appended to `audit_event` with

```
hash = HMAC-SHA256(hash-secret, "audit" ‖ prev_hash ‖ request_id ‖ event ‖ detail ‖ created_at)   (each field length-prefixed)
```

- A trigger rejects `UPDATE` and `DELETE` on the table.
- `GET /api/audit/verify` recomputes the chain from the first event and returns `{intact, eventsChecked, firstBrokenEventId}`.
- `GET /api/requests/{id}/certificate` (only when `COMPLETED`) returns the subject fingerprint (never the email), received/due/completed times, `onTime`, each system's result and note, the request's full history, and `auditHash`, the chain's latest link at issue time. Holding that hash anchors the log outside the database.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subject([Requester]) -->|"file / verify / cancel"| api
    admin([Admin]) -->|"/admin, certificate, audit verify"| api
    subgraph ForgetMe
      api[REST API + admin page] --> db[(PostgreSQL<br/>requests · tasks · audit chain)]
      disp[Dispatcher timer] --> db

    c1 & c2 & c3 & c4 -->|"signed report"| api
    api -->|"codes"| mail[SMTP / Mailpit]
    watch -->|"deadline alerts"| mail
```

Each connector is an ordinary app with the starter added. Everything between ForgetMe and the connectors is HMAC-signed.

### Data model

```
privacy_request (id, status, email_enc (null once finished), subject_hash, code_hash,
                 code_expires_at, code_attempts, received_at, due_at, run_after,
                 closed_at, deadline_alert)
connector       (id, name unique, endpoint_url, secret_enc, stage, created_at)
task            (id, request_id, connector_id, stage, status, result, note, attempts,
                 next_attempt_at, updated_at)       -- unique(request_id, connector_id)
                                                    -- partial index on next_attempt_at for open tasks
audit_event     (id bigserial, request_id, event, detail, created_at, prev_hash, hash)
                                                    -- append-only (trigger)
```

### API

| Method | Path | Caller | Purpose | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/requests` | public | File a request | ✅ |
| `POST` | `/api/requests/{id}/verify` | public | Confirm with the emailed code | ✅ |
| `POST` | `/api/requests/{id}/cancel` | public | Cancel before deletion starts | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/api/requests/{id}` | admin | Status, deadline and each connector's progress | ✅ |
| `POST` | `/api/requests/{id}/retry` | admin | Retry failed tasks after `NEEDS_ATTENTION` | ✅ |
| `POST` | `/api/connectors` | admin | Register a connector: `name`, `endpointUrl`, `stage`, optional `secret` (32+ chars, else generated). Returns the secret once | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/api/connectors` | admin | List connectors | ✅ |
| `POST` | `/api/callbacks/{taskId}` | connector (signed) | Report a result | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/api/requests/{id}/certificate` | admin | Completion certificate (409 until `COMPLETED`) | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/api/audit/verify` | admin | Re-check the whole audit hash chain | ✅ |

Verify responses: `200` code correct (request is now `WAITING`), `400` wrong code (says how many attempts are left), `410` expired or out of attempts, `409` request isn't awaiting a code.

Pages: `/` (ask), `/r/{id}` (confirm → watch → receipt, refreshes itself while work is in progress), `/admin` and `/admin/requests/{id}` (admin), `/swagger-ui.html` (API docs).

### A connector in 5 lines: the starter

Add `dev.forgetme:forgetme-spring-boot-starter`, define one bean:

```java
@Bean
ErasureHandler erasure(OrderRepository orders) {
    return subject -> {
        orders.removeEmail(subject.email());
        return ErasureResult.retained("invoices kept 8 years for tax law; email removed");
    };
}
```

and set `forgetme.connector.secret` to the secret ForgetMe returned at registration. Auto-configuration then exposes `POST /privacy/erase`, which:

1. verifies the signature and timestamp (`401` otherwise)
2. runs the handler. An exception → `500`, so ForgetMe retries with backoff
3. answers `202` and sends the signed report to `callbackUrl` on a virtual thread

Handlers must be idempotent: jobs are delivered at least once. If your app uses Spring Security, permit `POST /privacy/erase`; the signature is the authentication.

## Design decisions

| Decision | Why | Revisit when |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres job table, not Kafka | One less system to run; `SKIP LOCKED` gives safe concurrent workers | Throughput outgrows one database |
| Claim tasks with a lease, then send outside the transaction | No database lock is held during a slow HTTP call; if the app crashes mid-send, the lease expires and the task is picked up again | Never |
| Lock order is always request → task | Callbacks and the dispatcher touch both; one fixed order means they can't deadlock | Never |
| Request row locked while deciding the next stage | Otherwise two reports finishing the last two tasks at once could each see the other as still open, and the request would stall | Never |
| Exponential backoff (10 s, 20 s, 40 s, 80 s) | A struggling connector isn't hammered | Real deployments want hours between retries |
| Re-send with the same `taskId` | Connectors can recognize repeats; retries are safe | Never |
| Verify the signature before parsing the body | The signature covers the exact bytes; nothing untrusted is parsed first | Never |
| Connector secrets encrypted, codes hashed | Secrets must be recovered to sign messages; codes only need comparing | Never |
| Explicit `TransactionTemplate` in the dispatcher | Short, visible transactions; avoids the `@Transactional` self-call trap | Never |
| Enum + `moveTo()`, not a state-machine library | 7 states fit in one exhaustive `switch`; adding a state won't compile until its transitions are defined | States and branches multiply |
| Wrong code returns a result instead of throwing | A thrown exception rolls back the transaction, and with it the attempt counter | Never |
| Row lock (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) on verify and cancel | Parallel guesses queue up instead of racing past the 5-attempt limit | Never |
| Code stored as HMAC(server key, request ID + code) | A leaked database can't be brute-forced offline, and a hash is useless for any other request | Never |
| Forward-only saga, no rollback | A deletion can't be undone; failures retry or escalate | Never |
| Delete the primary record last | The orchestrator needs identifiers to reach downstream data | Never |
| Hash-chained audit log with HMAC, not plain SHA-256 | Tamper-evident, and someone with database access alone can't recompute the chain after an edit | External notarization is required |
| Append-only trigger *and* a hash chain | The trigger stops casual edits; the chain catches anyone who disables it | Never |
| Certificate carries the chain's latest hash | Anchors the log outside the database, even against someone holding the key | Never |
| Appends serialized with a Postgres advisory lock | Two concurrent appends could otherwise link to the same predecessor and fork the chain | Audit volume outgrows one lock (per-request chains) |
| Timestamps truncated to microseconds before hashing | Postgres stores microseconds; hashing more precision would make every re-verification fail | Never |
| Fields length-prefixed inside the hash | `("AB","C")` and `("A","BC")` can't collide | Never |
| Erase the email on every final state, keep an HMAC fingerprint | The privacy tool shouldn't itself be a PII store; the fingerprint proves who was deleted and allows re-applying deletions after a backup restore | Never |
| Audit details capped at 500 chars | A long connector note must never make a report fail and loop forever | Never |
| Starter API is one functional-interface bean, not annotation scanning | Less magic and less code; it's obvious where the handler comes from | Apps need several handlers |
| Starter runs the handler before answering, reports afterwards | Failures become a fast `500` + backoff instead of a 5-minute callback timeout | Handlers take longer than the 10 s read timeout |
| Signing code duplicated in the starter, pinned by a shared known-answer test | The starter stays dependency-free of the orchestrator; the test catches drift | A third component needs it (extract a protocol module) |
| Connectors may bring their own secret | Scripted setup (the demo, infrastructure-as-code); generated is still the default | Never |
| One demo app, four Spring profiles, in-memory data | One small class per system; the demo exists to show ForgetMe, not storage (MinIO dropped) | Never |
| Server-rendered pages, no SPA | Two templates and ~40 lines of CSS cover the whole visitor journey; a JavaScript app would add a build step and show nothing more | The UI needs real interactivity |
| One page for confirm → watch → receipt, refreshed with `<meta refresh>` | It's one thing to the requester, and the address is the only thing they must keep | You want a live progress bar (server-sent events) |
| Separate security filter chain for `/admin/**` | Browser forms need CSRF protection and a session; the stateless JSON API neither needs nor wants them | Never |
| Rate limits counted in memory, per IP | No extra infrastructure; each instance counts on its own | Running several instances (move to Redis) |
| A per-subject limit as well as per-IP | The IP limit alone doesn't stop a botnet filling one person's inbox with confirmation codes | Never |
| `prod` profile has no default secrets | A missing environment variable must stop startup, not silently fall back to a value published in this repo | Never |

## Security

- A 6-digit one-time code is emailed before anything runs. It's stored only as a keyed hash, expires in 24 hours, is single-use, and 5 wrong attempts reject the request
- Emails and connector secrets are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (random IV per value, tamper-detecting). The email is erased as soon as a request finishes; only a keyed fingerprint remains
- Every event is written to an append-only, HMAC-chained audit log that never contains personal data; deadline alerts to the admin carry only the request ID
- Every orchestrator ↔ connector message is HMAC-SHA256 signed over timestamp + body with a per-connector secret. Messages older than 5 minutes are rejected; a repeat inside that window is harmless because duplicate reports are ignored
- API responses never include the email address
- Request IDs are random UUIDs; everything except file/verify/cancel and signed callbacks requires admin login
- Public endpoints are rate-limited: `forgetme.filings-per-hour` per IP (20 dev, 5 prod) and 3 per email address per day. `forgetme.allowed-email-domains` restricts who can be emailed at all — the public demo only accepts `example.com`
- The admin page runs on its own filter chain with CSRF protection, and 10 failed logins lock that IP out for the rest of the hour (`AdminLoginGuard`, ahead of Spring Security in the filter order)
- Behind the reverse proxy, Caddy overwrites `X-Forwarded-For` rather than appending to it, so a caller can't invent an address and reset their own rate limit
- Both images run as an unprivileged user; nothing but Caddy is exposed to the internet, and `.env` is git-ignored
- Dependabot opens a weekly PR for outdated libraries and actions

**Known gaps:** connector URLs are admin-entered and not restricted, so an admin could point one at an internal address, and the subject's email travels to them signed but not encrypted, so connector endpoints should be HTTPS. Rate-limit counters are per-instance and reset on restart. The public demo deliberately exposes Mailpit at `/mail`, so any visitor can read any demo confirmation code — that is the demo, not the design. The demo's connector secrets are written in `compose.yaml` and labelled demo-only. Development secrets in `application.yml` are placeholders; the `prod` profile has no defaults and refuses to start without `FORGETME_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `FORGETME_HASH_SECRET` and `FORGETME_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omkar-sanadi/ForgetMe.git && cd ForgetMe
```

### Option A: the full demo, one command

**Needs:** Docker only. Port 8080 must be free.

```bash
docker compose --profile demo up --build
```

This builds everything and starts ForgetMe, the four demo systems, Postgres and Mailpit. A setup step then registers the systems (wait for `Demo ready`). If you've used this checkout before, `docker compose down -v` first gives you a clean database. If something else already uses port 8080, set `FORGETME_PORT=8090` (any free port) and use that in the URLs below.

Then open **http://localhost:8080/** and delete `alice@example.com` from the page: it emails a code (read it at http://localhost:8025), you confirm, and the page shows each system reporting in, ending with a receipt. Or do the same over the API:

```bash
# Delete Alice. Get the code from http://localhost:8025
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/requests -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email":"alice@example.com"}'
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/requests/<id>/verify -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"code":"<code>"}'

# Watch her disappear (refresh): mailing → uploads + orders → users. Bob stays.
curl -s localhost:8084/data; curl -s localhost:8083/data; curl -s localhost:8082/data; curl -s localhost:8081/data

# About a minute later
curl -s -u admin:admin localhost:8080/api/requests/<id>/certificate
```

Measured on a laptop: done in 48 s (20 s cooling-off, one deliberate retry on mailing, three stages), certificate complete, audit chain intact.

The admin page is at **http://localhost:8080/admin** (`admin` / `admin` locally) and the API docs at **http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html**.

### Option B: develop ForgetMe itself

**Needs:** Java 21 (`JAVA_HOME` must point to it) and Docker.

```bash
docker compose up -d                          # just Postgres + Mailpit
./mvnw -pl orchestrator spring-boot:run       # Windows: .\mvnw.cmd -pl orchestrator spring-boot:run
```

Try it:
```bash
# 1. Register a connector (admin). Save the secret it returns.
curl -s -u admin:admin -X POST localhost:8080/api/connectors -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"mailing","endpointUrl":"http://localhost:9999/erase","stage":1}'

# 2. File a request, read the code at http://localhost:8025 (Mailpit inbox), confirm it
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/requests -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email":"you@example.com"}'
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/requests/<id>/verify -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"code":"<code>"}'

# 3. After the 1-minute cooling-off, watch the app log and the admin view
curl -s -u admin:admin localhost:8080/api/requests/<id>

# 4. Check the audit chain; get the certificate once a request is COMPLETED
curl -s -u admin:admin localhost:8080/api/audit/verify
curl -s -u admin:admin localhost:8080/api/requests/<id>/certificate
```
Nothing listens on port 9999, so you'll see the retries in the log and the request end in `NEEDS_ATTENTION` after about 2.5 minutes. With no connectors registered, a request completes straight after cooling-off, which is the quickest way to see a certificate. For connectors that really delete things, use Option A.

Dev settings live in `application.yml`: `cooling-off` (1 min), `retry-backoff` (10 s, doubling), `callback-timeout` (5 min), `tick` (5 s), `admin-email` (deadline alerts; lands in Mailpit).

Run the tests:
```bash
./mvnw test
```
This runs all three modules' tests. The orchestrator's end-to-end tests (`RequestFlowTest`) start a throwaway Postgres in Docker and are skipped automatically when Docker isn't running.

## Performance

Measured with [k6](loadtest/file-and-verify.js) on one laptop, everything (orchestrator, Postgres, four connectors) in Docker on the same machine. Method and how to repeat it: [phase 5](docs/phase-5.md#the-numbers-measured-not-guessed).

| Audit events written, chain verified | 2,200, intact |

## Deploying

`deploy/` holds a production compose file, a Caddy config (automatic HTTPS, no other port exposed) and a secrets template. On any Linux server with Docker:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env    # fill in DOMAIN + secrets (openssl rand -base64 32)
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f compose.yaml -f deploy/compose.prod.yaml --profile demo up -d --build
```

The `prod` profile refuses to start without real secrets, waits a day before deleting, spreads retries over hours, and accepts only `example.com` addresses so a public demo can never email a real person. Full walkthrough, including getting a free server and an HTTPS name without buying a domain: [phase 5](docs/phase-5.md#putting-it-on-a-server-your-step).

## Non-goals

- Legal advice or compliance certification
- Discovering where personal data lives (you register connectors; ForgetMe doesn't scan)
- A single-page JavaScript app (the pages are plain server-rendered HTML)

## For a CV

> Built **ForgetMe**, a self-hosted GDPR/DPDP erasure orchestrator (Java 21, Spring Boot 4, PostgreSQL): verifies the requester, fans a deletion out to every registered system in stages over HMAC-signed HTTP, retries with backoff and escalates to a human, then issues a certificate backed by an HMAC hash-chained, append-only audit log. Job queue is a Postgres table claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and a lease, so no lock is held across network calls. Ships a Spring Boot starter that turns any service into a connector in ~5 lines, plus a one-command four-service demo. Measured 66 verified requests/s and ~400 fully fanned-out deletions/min on a laptop; 29 tests on CI.

## Prior art

OneTrust, Transcend, DataGrail and Ketch (commercial SaaS); Fides by Ethyca (open source, Python). ForgetMe's angle: lightweight, self-hosted, Java/Spring-native, with a drop-in connector starter.
